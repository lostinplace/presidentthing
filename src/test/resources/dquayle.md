'''James Danforth''' "'''Dan'''" '''Quayle''' (born February 4, 1947) is an American politician. He was the [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|44th]] [[Vice President of the United States]], serving during the term of President [[George H. W. Bush]] (1989–93). He was also a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] (1977–81) and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] (1981–89) from the state of Indiana.

Quayle was born in Indianapolis and spent most of his childhood living in Arizona. He married [[Marilyn Tucker]] in 1972 and obtained his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law|Indiana University School of Law – Indianapolis]] in 1974. He practiced law in [[Huntington, Indiana]], with his wife before his election to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1976, aged 29. In 1980 Quayle won election to the Senate.

In 1988, Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee for the presidency, chose Quayle as his vice presidential running mate. The Bush/Quayle ticket won the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 election]] over Democrats [[Michael Dukakis]] and [[Lloyd Bentsen]].

As vice president, Quayle made official visits to 47 countries and was appointed chairman of the [[National Space Council]]. He secured re-nomination for vice-president in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]], but Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] and his vice presidential running mate, [[Al Gore]], defeated the Bush/Quayle ticket.

In 1994, Quayle published his memoir entitled ''Standing Firm'' but declined to run for public office in this time period because he was suffering from [[phlebitis]]. He sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew and supported [[George W. Bush]]. {{As of | 2014}}{{update after|2015|9|16}} Quayle and his wife reside in [[Paradise Valley, Arizona]].

Quayle {{as of | 2016 | alt = currently}}{{update after|2017|9|16}} is the chairman of global investments at [[Cerberus Capital Management]].

==Early life==
Quayle was born in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, to Martha Corinne (née Pulliam) and [[James C. Quayle|James Cline Quayle]]. He has often{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} been incorrectly referred to as ''James Danforth Quayle III''. In his memoirs, he points out that his birth name was simply James Danforth Quayle. The name Quayle originates from the [[Isle of Man]], where his great-grandfather was born.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/quayle.html |title=Ancestry of Dan Quayle (b. 1947) |publisher=Wargs.com |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref>

His maternal grandfather, [[Eugene C. Pulliam]], was a wealthy and influential publishing magnate who founded Central Newspapers, Inc., owner of over a dozen major newspapers such as ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' and ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]''. James C. Quayle moved his family to [[Arizona]] in 1955 to run a branch of the family's publishing empire. While his family was very wealthy, Quayle was less affluent; his total net worth by the time of his election in 1988 was less than $1 million.<ref>[[Ramesh Ponnuru]], [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_6_51/ai_54460250 No Joke: Dan Quayle runs to win], ''[[National Review]]'', April 5, 1999. Retrieved May 16, 2007.</ref>

After spending much of his youth in Arizona,<ref>http://www.vicepresidentdanquayle.com/biography.html</ref> Quayle graduated from Huntington High School in [[Huntington, Indiana]], in 1965. He then matriculated at [[DePauw University]], where he received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A. degree]] in [[political science]] in 1969,<ref>{{cite news |first=Jill |last=Lawrence |title=Quayle on a quest to get the last laugh |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/e193.htm |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=August 4, 1999 |accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref> was a 3-year letterman for the University Golf Team (1967–69) and a member of the fraternity [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] (Psi Phi chapter). After receiving his degree, Quayle joined the [[Indiana Army National Guard]] and served from 1969–1975, reaching the rank of [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]]. While serving in the Guard, he earned a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) degree in 1974 at [[Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law|Indiana University School of Law – Indianapolis]]. He met his future wife, [[Marilyn Quayle|Marilyn]], who was taking night classes at McKinney at the time.<ref name="Time">Alessandra Stanley, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956763,00.html "Marilyn Quayle: A New Second Lady"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', January 23, 1989. Accessed September 28, 2014.</ref>

==Early political career==
[[File:Dan Quayle 1977.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Quayle in 1977, his first term in Congress]]
Quayle became an investigator for the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the [[Indiana Attorney General]] in July 1971. Later that year, he became an administrative assistant to Governor [[Edgar Whitcomb]]. From 1973 to 1974, he was the Director of the Inheritance Tax Division of the Indiana Department of Revenue. Upon receiving his law degree, Quayle worked as associate publisher of his family's newspaper, the ''[[Huntington Herald-Press]]''.

In 1976, Quayle was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from [[Indiana's 4th congressional district]], defeating eight-term [[incumbent]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[J. Edward Roush]] by a 55%-to-45% margin. He won reelection in 1978 by the greatest percentage margin achieved to date in that northeast Indiana district. In [[United States Senate elections, 1980|1980]], at age 33, Quayle became the youngest person ever elected to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] from the state of Indiana, defeating three-term incumbent Democrat [[Birch Bayh]] by taking 54% of the votes to Bayh's 46%. Making Indiana political history again, Quayle was re-elected to the Senate in [[United States Senate elections, 1986|1986]] with the largest margin ever achieved to that date by a candidate in a statewide Indiana race, taking 61% of the vote and defeating his Democratic opponent, [[Jill Long]].

In November 1978, Quayle was invited by Congressman [[Leo Ryan]] of California to accompany him on a delegation to investigate conditions at the [[Jonestown]] settlement in [[Guyana]], but Quayle, as it happened, was unable to  participate. Ryan was subsequently murdered in events leading up to the [[Jonestown massacre]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Quayle |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Quayle |title=Standing Firm: A Vice-Presidential Memoir |publisher=Harpercollins |year=1995 |page=176 |isbn=0-06-109390-4}}</ref>

In 1986, Quayle was criticized for championing the cause of [[Daniel Anthony Manion]], a candidate for a federal appellate judgeship, who was in law school one year above Quayle. The [[American Bar Association]] had evaluated Manion as "qualified/unqualified", its lower passing grade.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/25/us/reagan-judges-get-lower-bar-rating.html | work=New York Times | title=REAGAN JUDGES GET LOWER BAR RATING| date=May 25, 1986 | accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>  Manion was nominated for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]] of the [[United States court of appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]] on February 21, 1986, and confirmed by the Senate on June 26, 1986.<ref name="PostGazette">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Qa9RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xG4DAAAAIBAJ&dq=daniel%20manion&pg=6717%2C6531359|title=Senate reaffirms Daniel Manion as judge, 50–49|date=July 24, 1986|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>

==Vice presidential candidate==
On August 17, 1988, at the Republican convention in New Orleans, Louisiana, George H. W. Bush chose Quayle to be his running mate in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 United States presidential election]]. The choice immediately became controversial.<ref name="Quagmire" /> Outgoing President Ronald Reagan praised Quayle for his "energy and enthusiasm".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Steven|title=Reagan Praises Quayle, Citing 'Enthusiasm'|work=[[New York Times]]|date= August 21, 1988}}</ref> Press coverage of the convention was dominated with questions about "the three Quayle problems", in the phrase of Brent Baker, executive director of the [[Media Research Center]], a [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] group that monitors television coverage.<ref name="NYTimesGarbled" /> The questions involved his military service, a golf trip to Florida with [[Paula Parkinson]], and whether he had enough experience to be president. Quayle seemed at times rattled and at other times uncertain or evasive as he tried to handle the questions.<ref name="NYTimesGarbled" /> Delegates to the convention generally blamed television and newspapers for the focus on Quayle's problems, but Bush's staff said they thought Quayle had mishandled the questions about his military record, leaving questions dangling.<ref name="Quagmire">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968278-1,00.html|title=The Republicans: The Quayle Quagmire|last=Shapiro |first=Walter |date= August 29, 1988 |work=Time|page=32|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref><ref name="NYTimesGarbled">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/19/us/the-republicans-in-new-orleans-convention-message-is-garbled-by-quayle-static.html?pagewanted=all|title=The Republicans in New Orleans; Convention Message Is Garbled by Quayle Static |last=Oreskes|first=Michael|date=August 19, 1988|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref><ref>Ander Plattner et al., "Quayle Under Glass", ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', August 29, 1988, p. 32.</ref> Although Bush was trailing by up to 15 points in public opinion polls taken before the convention, in August, the Bush/Quayle ticket took the lead,<ref>[http://www.gallup.com/poll/110548/gallup-presidential-election-trialheat-trends-19362004.aspx#4 1988 Presidential Trial Heats ] Gallup.</ref> which they did not relinquish for the rest of the campaign.

Quayle participated in the vice presidential debate of October 1988, alongside Democratic candidate [[Lloyd Bentsen]]. When the subject of the debate turned to Quayle's relatively limited experience in public life, he compared the length of his congressional service with that of late President [[John F. Kennedy]]. Bentsen's response – "[[Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy]]" – subsequently became a part of the political lexicon.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Vice presidency==
{{POV section|date=May 2012}}

The Bush/Quayle ticket won the [[United States presidential election, 1988|November election]] with a 53–46 percent margin by sweeping 40 states and capturing 426 [[electoral college|electoral votes]].

Bush named Quayle head of the [[Council on Competitiveness]] and the first chairman of the [[National Space Council]]. As head of the NSC he called for greater efforts to protect Earth against the danger of potential [[asteroid]] impacts.<ref>[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900516&slug=1072013 "Quayle Backs Group's Effort To Head Off Asteroid Threat"], ''[[Seattle Times]]'', May 16, 1990</ref>

After a briefing by Lt. General [[Daniel O. Graham]], (USA Ret.), Max Hunter, and [[Jerry Pournelle]], Quayle sponsored the development of an experimental Single Stage to Orbit X-Program, which resulted in the building of the DC/X which was flown and tested at White Sands.

During his vice-presidency, Dan Quayle made official trips to 47 countries.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Throughout his time as vice president, Quayle was widely ridiculed in the media and by many in the general public, both in the U.S. and overseas, as an intellectual lightweight and generally incompetent.<ref>{{cite news

</ref> Contributing greatly to the perception of Quayle's incompetence was his tendency to make public statements that were either self-contradictory, confused, or impossible ("The [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] was an obscene period in our nation's history. ... No, not our nation's, but in [[World War II]]. I mean, we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history"), or ("I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future") or this quote, from when he addressed the [[United Negro College Fund]], whose slogan is "A mind is a terrible thing to waste," where he said, "You take the UNCF model that what a waste it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is."<ref>{{cite news

Shortly after Bush announced the [[Space Exploration Initiative]], which included a manned landing on [[Mars]], Quayle was asked his thoughts on [[Manned mission to Mars|sending humans to Mars]]. In his response he made a series of scientifically erroneous statements: "Mars is essentially in the same [[Solar System#Structure and composition|orbit]] [as Earth]....Mars is somewhat the same [[Astronomical unit#Examples|distance from the Sun]], which is very important. We have seen pictures where there are [[Martian canals|canals]], we believe, and water. If there is [[Water on Mars|water]], that means there is [[Electrolysis of water|oxygen]]. If oxygen, that means we can breathe."<ref>William E. Burrows, ''This New Ocean'', p. 576. ISBN 0-679-44521-8.</ref>

During the 1992 presidential campaign, Quayle told the news media that he believed homosexuality was a choice, and "the wrong choice."

==="Potatoe"===
On June 15, 1992, Quayle altered 12-year-old student William Figueroa's correct spelling of "potato" to "potatoe" at the Muñoz Rivera Elementary School [[spelling bee]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalcentury.com/1992.html|title=1992: Gaffe with an 'e' at the end |first=Paul |last=Mickle |publisher=Capitalcentury.com |accessdate=July 1, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/nyregion/politics-how-do-you-spell-regret-one-man-s-take-on-it.html|title=How Do You Spell Regret?

According to ''The New York Times''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/17/opinion/mr-quayle-s-e-for-effort.html | work=The New York Times | title=Mr. Quayle's 'e' for Effort | date=June 17, 1992}}</ref> and Quayle's memoirs, he was relying on cards provided by the school, which Quayle says included the misspelling. Quayle said he was uncomfortable with the version he gave, but did so because he decided to trust the school's incorrect written materials instead of his own judgment.

===Murphy Brown===
On May 19, 1992, Quayle gave a speech entitled ''[[s:Reflections on Urban America|Reflections on Urban America]]'' to the [[Commonwealth Club of California]] on the subject of the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992|Los Angeles riots]]. In this speech, Quayle blamed the violence on a decay of moral values and family structure in American society. In an aside, he cited the single mother title character in the television program ''[[Murphy Brown]]'' as an example of how popular culture contributes to this "poverty of values", saying, "It doesn't help matters when [[prime time]] TV has Murphy Brown – a character who supposedly epitomizes today's intelligent, highly paid, professional woman – mocking the importance of fathers, by bearing a child alone, and calling it just another 'lifestyle choice'."<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975627,00.html | title=Dan Quayle vs. Murphy Brown | work=Time  | date=June 1, 1992 | accessdate=June 24, 2010}}</ref>

The "[[Murphy Brown#Murphy becomes a single mother|Murphy Brown speech]]" became one of the most memorable incidents of the 1992 campaign. Long after the outcry had ended, the comment continued to have an effect on U.S. politics. [[Stephanie Coontz]], a professor of family history and the author of several books and essays about the history of [[marriage]], says that this brief remark by Quayle about Murphy Brown "kicked off more than a decade of outcries against the 'collapse of the family{{'"}}.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/30/AR2005043000108.html | work=The Washington Post | title=For Better, For Worse | first=Stephanie | last=Coontz | date=May 1, 2005 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> In 2002, [[Candice Bergen]], the actress who played Brown, said "I never have really said much about the whole episode, which was endless, but his speech was a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did." Others interpreted it differently; singer [[Tanya Tucker]] was widely quoted as saying "Who the hell is Dan Quayle to come after single mothers?"<ref>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Candice Bergen agrees with Quayle |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/News/07/11/showbuzz/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=July 11, 2002 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080328133715/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/News/07/11/showbuzz/index.html#1|archivedate=March 28, 2008}}</ref>

===1992 election===
During the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 election]], Bush and Quayle were challenged in their bid for reelection by the Democratic ticket of [[Governor of Arkansas|Arkansas Governor]] [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Tennessee]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Al Gore]], as well as the independent ticket of Texas businessman [[Ross Perot]] and retired Admiral [[James Stockdale]].

As Bush lagged in the polls in the weeks preceding the August [[1992 Republican National Convention]], some Republican strategists (led by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James Baker]]) viewed Quayle as a liability to the ticket and pushed for his replacement.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/07/15/MNGH97LG321.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Rumor has it that Cheney's on way out / Theory appears far-fetched but is making the rounds | first=Elisabeth | last=Bumiller | date=July 15, 2004}}</ref> Quayle survived the challenge and secured renomination.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976809-1,00.html "Quayle Vs.

Quayle faced off against Gore and Stockdale in the vice presidential [[debate]] on October 13, 1992. Quayle attempted to avoid the one-sided outcome of his debate with Lloyd Bentsen four years earlier by staying on the offensive. Quayle criticized Gore's book ''[[Earth in the Balance]]'' with specific page references, though his claims were subsequently criticized by the liberal group [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|FAIR]] for inaccuracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fair.org/take-action/media-advisories/post-debate-fact-checking-is-medias-main-job/ |title=FAIR MEDIA ADVISORY: Post-Debate Fact-Checking Is Media's Main Job |publisher=Fair.org |date=September 29, 2004 }}</ref> Quayle's closing argument sharply asked voters, "Do you really believe Bill Clinton will tell the truth?" and "Do you trust Bill Clinton to be your president?", whereas Gore and Stockdale talked more about the policies and philosophies they espoused.<ref>{{cite web|title=Debate Transcript, Commission on Presidential Debates |url=http://www.debates.org/pages/trans92d.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009182330/http://www.debates.org/pages/trans92d.html |archivedate=October 9, 2009 }}</ref> Republican loyalists were largely relieved and pleased with Quayle's performance, and the Vice President's camp attempted to portray it as an upset triumph against a veteran debater. However, post-debate polls were mixed on whether Gore, Stockdale or Quayle had won.<ref>''Columbia Journalism Review'', September/October 1993 "http://archives.cjr.org/year/93/5/books-rosensteil.asp</ref> It ultimately proved to be a minor factor in the election, which Bush and Quayle subsequently lost.

==Post-Vice Presidency politics==
Quayle considered but decided against running for [[Governor of Indiana]] in 1996. He decided against running for the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1996|1996 Republican presidential nomination]], citing health problems related to [[phlebitis]].<ref name="broder">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/election/july-dec99/quayle_9-27.html |title=David Broder on PBS Newshour.

In April 1999, Quayle announced his candidacy for the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000|2000 Republican presidential nomination]], attacking front-runner [[George W. Bush]] by saying "we do not want another candidate who needs on-the-job training". In the first contest among the Republican candidates, the [[Ames Straw Poll]] of August 1999, he finished 8th. He withdrew from the race the following month and supported Bush.<ref name="broder"/>
