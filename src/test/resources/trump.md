Trump sought the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2000|presidential nomination in 2000]], but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election]], but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]]. Trump's [[Political positions of Donald Trump|platform]] emphasizes renegotiating [[China–United States relations#Economic relations|U.S.–China trade deals]], opposing [[free trade]] agreements such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] and the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]], strongly enforcing [[Illegal immigration to the United States|immigration laws]], and building a wall along the [[Mexico–U.S. border]]. His other policies include pursuing [[energy independence]] while opposing [[climate change]] regulations such as the [[Clean Power Plan]] and the [[Paris Agreement]], reforming [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|veterans' affairs]], replacing "[[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obamacare]]" with a more competitive system, abolishing [[Common Core]] education standards, [[Infrastructure-based development|investing in infrastructure]], simplifying the [[Internal Revenue Code|tax code]], and reducing taxes across the board, while imposing [[tariff]]s on U.S. corporations exporting jobs to or importing goods from foreign countries.

He self-identifies as a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], and [[Trumpism|his ideology]] is described by scholars and commentators as [[Populism|populist]], [[Protectionism in the United States|protectionist]] and [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]].

Trump quickly emerged as the front-runner in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican primaries]] among 17 contenders. His final rivals suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the [[2016 Republican National Convention|Republican Convention]]. On November 8, Trump won the [[United States presidential election, 2016|presidential election]] by gaining a majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]], although he received fewer [[popular vote (representative democracy)|popular votes]] nationwide than [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[presidential nominee|nominee]] [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>{{cite news|title=2016 election results|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/results|issue=CNN Politics|publisher=CNN}}</ref><!-- Please do not change this formulation before discussing on [[Talk:Donald Trump#Hillary Clinton did not win the popular vote.

==== Early Manhattan developments ====
Trump's first big deal in Manhattan was the remodeling of the [[Grand Hyatt New York|Grand Hyatt Hotel]] in 1978 next to [[Grand Central Terminal]] from an older Commodore Hotel, which was largely funded by a $70 million construction loan jointly guaranteed by Fred Trump and the [[Hyatt]] hotel chain.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wooten|first=Sara McIntosh|date=2009|title=Donald Trump: From Real Estate to Reality TV|pages=32–35|isbn=0-7660-2890-9}}</ref><ref name=WashingtonPost>{{cite news|first=Glenn|last=Kessler|title=Trump's false claim he built his empire with a 'small loan' from his father|date=March 3, 2016|website=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/03/trumps-false-claim-he-built-his-empire-with-a-small-loan-from-his-father}}</ref>

In 1978, Trump finished negotiations to develop [[Trump Tower]], a 58-story, 202-meter (663-foot) skyscraper in [[Midtown Manhattan]], for which ''The New York Times'' attributed his "persistence" and "skills as a negotiator".<ref>{{cite news |title=The Expanding Empire of Donald Trump |date=April 8, 1984 |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/magazine/the-expanding-empire-of-donald-trump.html?pagewanted=all}}</ref> The building was completed in 1983, and houses both the primary [[penthouse apartment|penthouse]] [[condominium]] residence of Donald Trump and the headquarters of The Trump Organization.<ref name=TrumpTowerResidence>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/us/politics/new-york-primary.html |title=With the New York Presidential Primary, the Circus Is Coming Home |first1=Matt |last1=Flegenheimer |first2=Maggie |last2=Haberman |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 29, 2016 |accessdate=March 29, 2016}}</ref> Trump Tower was the setting of the NBC television show ''The Apprentice'', including a fully functional television studio set.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |date=n.d. |accessdate=May 24, 2016 |website=Trump Tower New York |url=http://www.trumptowerny.com/trump-tower-new-york}}</ref>

Repairs on the [[Wollman Rink]] in [[Central Park]], built in 1955, were started in 1980 by a [[general contractor]] unconnected to Trump, with an expected {{frac|2|1|2}}-year construction schedule, but were not completed by 1986. Trump took over the project, completed it in three months for $1.95&nbsp;million, which was $750,000 less than the initial budget, and then operated the rink for one year with all profits going to charity in exchange for the rink's [[Concession (contract)|concession]] rights.<ref name="Bloomberg L.P">{{cite news|last1=Freedlander|first1=David|title=A 1980s New York City Battle Explains Donald Trump's Candidacy|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2015-09-29/a-1980s-new-york-city-battle-explains-donald-trump-s-candidacy|accessdate=October 23, 2016|agency=Bloomberg|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=September 29, 2015}}</ref>

{{Main article|Mar-a-Lago}}
Trump acquired the historical [[Mar-a-Lago]] estate in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], in 1985 for $5 million, plus $3 million for the home's furnishings. In addition to using the home as a winter retreat, Trump also turned it into a private club with membership fees of $150,000. At about the same time, he acquired a condominium complex in Palm Beach with [[Lee Iacocca]] that became Trump Plaza of the Palm Beaches.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wooten |first=Sara McIntosh |date=2009 |title=Donald Trump: From Real Estate to Reality TV |page=62 |isbn=0-7660-2890-9}}</ref>

In 1983, Trump's [[New Jersey Generals]] became a charter member of the new [[United States Football League]] (USFL). The USFL played its first three seasons during the spring and summer, but Trump convinced the majority of the owners of other USFL teams to move the USFL 1986 schedule to the fall, directly opposite the [[National Football League]] (NFL), arguing that it would eventually force a merger with the NFL, which would supposedly increase their investment significantly.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/and-then-there-was-the-time-donald-trump-bought-a-football-team-/2015/10/19/35ae71ca-6dd6-11e5-aa5b-f78a98956699_story.html |title=And then there was the time Donald Trump bought a football team |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 19, 2015 |accessdate=January 17, 2016 |author=Terris, Ben}}</ref>

After the 1985 season, the Generals merged with the [[Houston Gamblers]], but had continuing financial troubles.

Trump attempted to buy the NFL's [[Buffalo Bills]] in 2014 but was unsuccessful.

In October 2016, it was revealed that Trump had claimed a loss of $916 million on his 1995 tax returns.

There are still plenty of unknowns.

After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump's focus shifted to the [[United States presidential election, 2016|general election]], urging remaining primary voters to "save [their] vote for the general election."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://time.com/4320484/donald-trump-west-virginia-primary-stay-home/ |title=Donald Trump Tells West Virginia Primary Voters to Stay Home |first=Tessa |last=Berenson |date=May 5, 2016 |work=Time}}</ref> Trump began targeting [[Hillary Clinton]], who became the presumptive [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee on June 6, 2016, and continued to campaign across the country. One month before the [[2016 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]], [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents thwarted an assassination attempt on Trump by a 20-year-old British man [[Illegal immigrant population of the United States|illegally residing in the U.S.]] during one of his rallies in [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/5e545c4b80054368989ed2b7dc669f4d/authorities-uk-man-arrested-rally-planned-kill-trump |title=Fuller picture emerges of man arrested at Trump rally |work=Associated Press}}</ref>

Clinton had established a significant lead in [[Nationwide opinion polling for the United States presidential election, 2016|national polls]] over Trump throughout most of 2016.

Trump's victory was considered a big political upset, as nearly all national polls at the time showed Hillary Clinton with a modest lead over Trump, and state polls showed her with a modest lead to win the electoral college.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/election-results-2016-clinton-trump-231070 |title=Trump pulls off biggest upset in U.S. history |publisher=[[Politico]] |date=November 9, 2016 |first=Maxwell |last=Tani |accessdate=November 9, 2016}}</ref> The errors in some state polls were later attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton's support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump's support among white working-class voters.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/upshot/why-trump-won-working-class-whites.html |title=Why Trump Won: Working-Class Whites |publisher=The New York Times |date=November 9, 2016 |first=Nate |last=Cohn |accessdate=November 9, 2016}}</ref> Trump's victory marked the first time that Republicans [[United States Presidents and control of Congress|would control]] the White House and both chambers of [[United States Congress|Congress]] since the period 2003–2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/republicans-1928-control/ |title=Republicans Last Controlled in 1928 and Depression Followed? |publisher=[[Snopes]] |first=Kim |last=LaCapria |accessdate=November 14, 2016}}</ref>

In the early hours of November 9, 2016, Trump received a phone call in which Clinton conceded the presidency to him. Trump then delivered his victory speech before hundreds of supporters in the [[New York Hilton Midtown|Hilton Hotel]] in New York City. The speech was in stark contrast with his previous rhetoric, with Trump promising to heal the division caused by the election, thanking Clinton for her service to the country, and promising to be a president to all Americans.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/trump-victory-speech-transcript-2016-11?r=US&IR=T |title='It's time for us to come together': Trump strikes conciliatory tone in victory speech |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |date=November 9, 2016 |first=Oliver |last=Darcy |accessdate=November 9, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.yahoo.com/tv/donald-trump-makes-first-speech-080352428.html |title=Donald Trump Makes First Speech as President-Elect, Thanks Hillary Clinton for Her 'Service' — Watch Video |publisher=[[Yahoo]] |first=Andy |last=Swift |date=November 9, 2016 |accessdate=November 9, 2016}}</ref>
