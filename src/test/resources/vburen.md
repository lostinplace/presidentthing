'''Martin Van Buren''' ({{lang-nl|Maarten van Buren}}<ref>[[:File:Martin Van Buren Baptism record.jpg|Baptism record at Kinderhook, New York Dutch Reformed Church]]</ref>{{pronunciation|Maarten van Buren.ogg}}; December 5, 1782 – July 24, 1862) was an American [[politician]] who served as the eighth [[President of the United States]] (1837–41).  A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he served in a number of senior roles, including eighth [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] (1833–37) and tenth [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] (1829–31), both under [[Andrew Jackson]].  Van Buren's inability as president to deal with the deep  economic depression following  the [[Panic of 1837]] and with the surging [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] led to his defeat in the 1840 election.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lansford |first1=Tom |last2=Woods |first2=Thomas E. |date=2008 |title=Exploring American History: From Colonial Times to 1877 |volume=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02K5EYvo5loC&pg=PA1047 |location=Tarrytown, NY |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |page=1047 |isbn=978-0-7614-7758-7 |quote=Still, he took much of the blame for the Panic of 1837; it was a major factor in his losing the 1840 election.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Valelly |first=Richard M., editor |date=2010 |title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Political History |volume=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8H-iCQAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA109 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=CQ Press |page=109 |isbn=978-0-87289-320-7 |quote=With a unified Whig party now a viable alternative to the Democrats nationally, the election of 1840 marked the beginning of the Second American Party System.}}</ref>

Of Dutch ancestry, Van Buren learned early to interact with people from multiple ethnic, income, and societal groups, which he used to his advantage as a political organizer. A meticulous dresser, he could mingle in upper class society as well as in saloon environments like the tavern his father ran.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sidey |first=Hugh |date=1999 |title=The Presidents of the United States of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eIujFN5vfwMC&q=%22martin+van+buren%22+%225+feet+6%22&dq=%22martin+van+buren%22+%225+feet+6%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Nc7KVObPHcykgwS0g4CIDw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBTgK |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=White House Historical Association |page=23}}</ref> A delegate to a political convention at age 18, he quickly moved from local to state politics, gaining fame both as a political organizer and an accomplished lawyer. Elected to the Senate by the state legislature in 1821, Van Buren supported [[William H. Crawford]] for president in the [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824 election]], but by [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828]] had come to support General Andrew Jackson.  Van Buren was a major supporter and organizer for Jackson in the 1828 election.  Jackson was elected, and made Van Buren [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].

During Jackson's eight years as president, Van Buren was a key advisor, and built the organizational structure for the coalescing Democratic Party, particularly in New York. In 1831, following his resignation as Secretary of State, Jackson gave Van Buren a [[recess appointment]] as [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|American minister to Britain]], but Van Buren's nomination was rejected by the Senate, cutting short his service in London.  He was successful in the jockeying to become Jackson's picked successor, and was elected vice president in 1832.  Van Buren defeated several Whig opponents in 1836, and was elected president.

As president, Van Buren was blamed for the depression of 1837; hostile newspapers called him "Martin Van Ruin". He attempted to cure the economic problems by keeping control of federal funds in an [[Independent Treasury|independent treasury]]—rather than in state banks—but Congress would not approve of this until 1840. In foreign affairs, he denied the application of [[Texas]] for admission to the Union, unwilling to upset the balance of free and slave states in the [[Missouri Compromise]], and hoping to avoid war with Mexico over Texas annexation by purchasing the territory from Mexico's government.  Additionally, relations with Britain and its colonies in [[Canada]] proved to be strained from the bloodless [[Aroostook War]] and the [[Caroline affair|''Caroline'' Affair]].

In [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840]], Van Buren was voted out of office, losing to Whig candidate [[William Henry Harrison]]. Van Buren was the leading candidate for the [[1844 Democratic National Convention|Democratic nomination in 1844]], but lost to [[James K. Polk]], who [[United States presidential election, 1844|went on to win the election]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848 election]] Van Buren ran unsuccessfully as the candidate of the anti-slavery [[Free Soil Party]]. He returned to the Democratic fold to support [[Franklin Pierce]] (1852), [[James Buchanan]] (1856), and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] (1860) for the presidency, but his increasingly [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] views and support for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] led him to support [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s policies after the start of the [[American Civil War]].

Van Buren's health began to fail in 1861, and he died in July 1862 at the age of seventy-nine. Although he served in many high offices, his most lasting achievement was as a political organizer who built the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|modern Democratic Party]] and guided it to dominance in the new [[Second Party System]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Cole |first=Donald B. |date=1984 |title=Martin Van Buren and the American Political System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqz_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA16 |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=16 |isbn=0-691-04715-4}}</ref>

Martin Van Buren was born on December 5, 1782, in the village of [[Kinderhook (village), New York|Kinderhook, New York]] about {{convert|20|mi}} south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on the [[Hudson River]]. He was the first president to be born after the United States [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared independence]]. He was [[baptized]] on December 15 of that year as "Maarten van Buren", the original [[Dutch language|Dutch]] spelling of his name. In the era before the steamboat, Kinderhook was an isolated village, and most of the townsfolk, including the Van Burens, spoke Dutch at home. Martin Van Buren is the only president who spoke [[American English|English]] as [[List of Presidents of the United States by languages spoken|a second language]]. Van Buren descended from Cornelis Maessen of the village of [[Buurmalsen]], near the town of [[Buren]] in the Netherlands, who had come to America in 1631 and purchased a plot of land on Manhattan Island; his son Martin Cornelisen took the surname Van Buren.<ref>Cole, pp. 3, 9</ref><ref>Widner, loc. 153–165</ref>

Van Buren had been active in politics from at least the age of 17, when he attended a party convention in [[Troy, New York]], where he worked successfully to secure for [[John Peter Van Ness]] the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] nomination in a special election for the [[New York's 6th congressional district|6th Congressional District]] seat.<ref>Brooke, p. 283</ref> He formed a law partnership with his half-brother [[James I. Van Alen]], and once established in his practice, he became financially secure enough to increase his focus on politics.<ref>{{cite book |last= Mackenzie |first= William Lyon |date= 1846 |title= The Life and Times of Martin Van Buren |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hXssAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA21 |publisher= Cooke & Co. |pages= 21–22}}</ref> He was a supporter of [[Aaron Burr]], and allied himself with the [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton faction]] of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. Van Buren supported [[Daniel D. Tompkins]] for Governor over incumbent [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]] in 1807.  Tompkins won, and his allies were a majority in the state legislature. As a result, Van Buren was appointed [[Probate court|Surrogate]] of [[Columbia County, New York]], replacing Van Alen, who had supported Lewis. Van Buren served as Surrogate from 1808 until 1813, when the [[Federalist Party]] obtained a majority in the state legislature and replaced him.<ref>{{cite book |last= Wilson |first= James Grant |date= 1898 |title= The Presidents of the United States 1789–1897 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qeY2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA169 |publisher= D.

Van Buren was a member of the [[New York State Senate]] from 1813 to 1820, and joined the [[Bucktails|opposition party]] in 1813.  (The opposition party were Democratic-Republicans who fought [[DeWitt Clinton]] for control of the Democratic-Republican Party in New York.)  Van Buren served as [[New York Attorney General]] from 1815 to 1819. He replaced [[William Floyd]] as a [[presidential elector]] in [[United States presidential election, 1820|1820]], and voted for [[James Monroe]] and [[Daniel D. Tompkins]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Weed |first= Thurlow |last2= Parsons |first2= John D. |date= 1879 |title= Civil List and Forms of Government of the Colony and State of New York |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iD1DAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA240 |publisher= Weed, Parsons & Co. |page= 345}}</ref>

Though he never served in the military, during the [[War of 1812]] Van Buren worked in the State Senate to pass war measures, including bills to expand the [[New York Army National Guard|New York Militia]] and increase soldier pay.  In addition, he was a special judge advocate appointed to serve as one of the prosecutors of [[William Hull]] during Hull's court-martial following the surrender of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hannings |first=Bud |date=2012 |title=The War of 1812: A Complete Chronology with Biographies of 63 General Officers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G46OgJcYeN0C&pg=PA327 |location=Jefferson, NC |publisher=McFarland & Company |page=327 |isbn=978-0-7864-6385-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Vile |first=John R.|date= 2001 |title=Great American Lawyers: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XR1NPiqp5aQC&pg=PA689|location= Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=ABC_CLIO |page=689 |isbn=9781576072028}}</ref>  In the winter of 1814–15 he exchanged ideas with [[Winfield Scott]] on ways to reorganize the [[New York Army National Guard|New York Militia]] in anticipation of another military campaign in 1815.  The reorganization would have included a position for Van Buren at a rank to be determined, but the conclusion of the war in February 1815 ended Scott and Van Buren's work on the project.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eisenhower |first=John S.

At first he opposed DeWitt Clinton's plan for the [[Erie Canal]], but he supported it when the [[Bucktails]] (the name given to the anti-DeWitt Clinton Democratic-Republicans) were able to gain a majority on the [[Erie Canal Commission]], and he supported a bill that raised money for the canal through the sale of state bonds.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nowlan |first= Robert A. |date= 2012 |title= The American Presidents, Washington to Tyler: What They Did, What They Said, What Was Said About Them, with Full Source Notes |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MlNWU1e9ppUC&pg=PA315 |publisher= McFarland Publishing |page= 315}}</ref>

In 1817, Van Buren's connection with so-called "machine politics" started when he created the first political organization encompassing all of New York, the Bucktails.<ref>{{cite news|title=Martin Van Buren|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/martinvanburen|accessdate=25 July 2013|work=[[The White House]]}}</ref> The Bucktails became a successful movement that emphasized party loyalty and used it to capture and control many patronage posts throughout New York. Van Buren gained the nickname of "Little Magician" for the skill with which he exploited what came to be called the "[[spoils system]]". Van Buren served as a member of the 1820 state [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]], where he favored expanded voting rights, but opposed universal suffrage and tried to maintain property requirements for voting.<ref>{{cite book |last= Keyssar |first= Alexander |date= 2000 |title= The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UijIgQP0xF8C&pg=PA55 |publisher= Basic Books |page= 55}}</ref>

He was the leading figure in the [[Albany Regency]], a group of Bucktail leaders who for more than a generation dominated the politics of New York and influenced national politics. The Regency, together with other political organizations such as [[Tammany Hall]], played a major role in expanding the spoils system and making it a recognized and accepted  procedure. He was the prime architect of the first nationwide political party: the [[Jacksonian Democrats]]  or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], which evolved from the Democratic-Republicans and relied on party loyalty and patronage to prevent contentious sectional issues, including tariffs and slavery, from becoming national crises. In Van Buren's words, "Without strong national political organizations, there would be nothing to moderate the prejudices between free and slaveholding states."<ref>"Martin Van Buren", pp. 103–114</ref> As had [[James Madison]] and other Democratic Party organizers who favored [[states' rights]] and local control, Van Buren was struggling to find an institutional solution to the Constitution's seeming inability to prevent concentration of power in an [[administrative republic]].{{sfn|Derthick|1999|p=102}}

Early in his life Van Buren owned a slave, a man named Tom who served as his personal valet.  Tom ran away in 1814 and eventually settled in [[Canada]], with Van Buren making no effort to locate him.  In 1824 Tom was found to be living in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].  Since he still legally owned Tom (under New York's gradual emancipation law, slavery was scheduled to be completely abolished in the state in 1827), Van Buren privately agreed to sell Tom to the finder for $50, provided the finder, a resident of [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]], could guarantee that Tom would be captured without violence. He could not make such a guarantee, and his willingness to pay was lessened by the knowledge that Tom would be emancipated in fewer than three years even if he was re-enslaved, so Tom remained free, as Van Buren probably intended.  (Allowing Tom to remain in Massachusetts unmolested without notice enabled Van Buren to avoid offending southern slave owners, as he would do if he publicly allowed a former slave to remain free.  At the same time, he avoided offending northern abolitionists, which he would do if he captured and re-enslaved a former slave.)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Navarro |first1=Bob |date=2006 |title=The Era of Change: Executives and Events in a Period of Rapid Expansion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXTvt4q00zAC&pg=PA78 |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |page=78 |isbn=1-4257-0473-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Van Buren |first1=Martin, author |last2= West |first2= Elizabeth Howard, editor |date=1910 |title= Calendar of the papers of Martin Van Buren|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEMFAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA72 |location=Washington |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |page= 72}}</ref>

===U.S. Senate and national politics===
[[File:MVanBuren.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Gubernatorial [[portrait]] of Martin Van Buren]]
In [[United States Senate election in New York, 1821|February 1821]], Martin Van Buren was elected a [[U.S. Senator from New York]], defeating incumbent [[Nathan Sanford]], who ran as the [[DeWitt Clinton|Clintonian]] candidate.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dodd |first= William Edward |date= 1899 |title= American Statesmen: Martin Van Buren |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kwE7AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA487 |publisher= Houghton, Mifflin & Co. |page= 76}}</ref> Van Buren at first favored [[internal improvements]], such as road repairs and canal construction; he proposed a constitutional amendment in 1824 to authorize such undertakings, but changed his position the following year. He voted for the [[tariff in American history|tariffs]] of 1824 and 1828, and then gradually abandoned this protectionist position, later coming out for tariffs "for revenue only."<ref>{{cite book |last= Holland |first= William M. |date= 1836 |title= The Life and Political Opinions of Martin Van Buren |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2s1cI5uNNZQC&pg=PA269 |publisher= Belknap & Hammersley |pages= 269–273}}</ref>

In the [[United States presidential election, 1824|presidential election of 1824]], Van Buren supported [[William H. Crawford]] and received the electoral vote of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for [[Vice President of the United States of America|Vice President]].  None of the presidential candidates—Crawford, [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Andrew Jackson]], or [[Henry Clay]]—had received a majority of the electoral college votes, so [[United States presidential election, 1824#1825 Contingent election|the choice fell]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]].  The House had to choose from among the top three candidates, so Clay was eliminated.  Van Buren had originally hoped to block [[John Quincy Adams]] by denying him the state of New York, which was divided between supporters of Crawford and Adams.  However, Representative [[Stephen Van Rensselaer]] swung New York to Adams.  Adams won, and appointed Clay as Secretary of State.  Because Clay had supported Adams in the House election, Jackson and Crawford supporters alleged corruption.<ref>{{cite book |last= Krabbendam |first= Hans, editor |date= 2009 |title= Four Centuries of Dutch-American Relations: 1609–2009 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BsFFWlQ8RwEC&pg=PA251 |publisher= State University of New York Press |page= 251}}</ref> After the House contest, Van Buren shrewdly kept out of [[Corrupt Bargain#Election of 1824|the controversy which followed]], and began looking forward to 1828. He switched his support early from Crawford, whose ill health after a stroke had made him a less than viable candidate, to [[Andrew Jackson]], who had won the popular vote in 1824.  Jackson was angered to see the presidency go to Adams after he received fewer popular votes, and eagerly looked forward to a rematch.<ref>{{cite book |last= Silbey |first= Joel H. |date= 2002 |title= Martin Van Buren and the Emergence of American Popular Politics |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9gUwSOypTuIC&pg=PA48 |publisher= Rowman and Littlefield |page= 44}}</ref>

Always notably courteous in his treatment of opponents, Van Buren showed no bitterness toward either Adams or [[Henry Clay]], and he voted for Clay's confirmation as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], notwithstanding Jackson's "[[corrupt bargain]]" charge.<ref>{{cite book |last= Shea |first= M.

Since Democrats, especially Southerners, were generally opposed to tariffs that increased the price of manufactured goods from the North but did not benefit the raw materials produced in the South, Van Buren could normally have been expected to oppose tariffs.  Political observers of the time viewed Van Buren's efforts to pass the 1828 tariff as part of the campaign to elect Jackson as President.  Anticipating that most Southerners would vote for Andrew Jackson no matter who else was running, Van Buren intended the tariff proposed by Jackson's Northern Democratic supporters in Congress to attract to Jackson's candidacy Northern voters, who generally favored high tariffs to protect the manufactured goods they produced.  Van Buren voted in favor, later adopting the cover story that he had done so only in response to instructions from the [[New York State Legislature]].  Most Democrats, especially Southerners, continued to oppose tariffs after 1828.  Van Buren's political opponents in the Democratic Party used his 1828 vote against him for years afterwards to prevent him from obtaining Southern support for his candidacies.<ref>{{cite book |last= Ayers |first= William L. |date= 2009 |title= American Passages: A History of the United States |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SbXS5-4QGAUC&pg=PA284 |publisher= Wadsworth Cengage Learning |page= 284}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Richter |first= William L. |date= 2006 |title= The A to Z of the Old South |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-VTh1AIqB5EC&pg=PA335 |publisher= Scarecrow Press |page= 335}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Force |first= Peter |date= 1840 |title= The Northern Man With Southern Principles, and the Southern Man With American Principles: Gen.

Van Buren was not considered to be an exceptional orator like Henry Clay or [[Daniel Webster]], but his more important speeches show careful preparation and his opinions carried weight; the oft-repeated charge that he refrained from declaring himself on crucial questions is hardly borne out by an examination of his senatorial career. In [[United States Senate election in New York, 1827|February 1827]], he was re-elected to the Senate by a large majority. He became one of the recognized managers of the Jackson campaign, and his tour of [[Virginia]], the [[Carolinas]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the spring of 1827 won support for Jackson from Crawford as Van Buren sought to reorganize and unify "the old Republican party" behind Jackson.<ref>Martin Van Buren to [[Thomas Ritchie]], January 13, 1827.</ref> At the state level, Jackson's committee chairs would split up the responsibilities around the state and organize volunteers at the local level. "Hurra Boys" would plant hickory trees (in honor of Jackson's nickname, "Old Hickory") or hand out hickory sticks at rallies. In 1828 Van Buren ran for [[Governor of New York]] in an effort to use his personal popularity to bolster Jackson's chances of carrying New York in the presidential election.  Jackson defeated Adams handily, leading the pro-Adams ''New York American'' to editorialize "Organization is the secret of victory.  By the want of it we have been overthrown."<ref>{{cite book |last= Remini |first= Robert V. |date= 2002 |title= John Quincy Adams: The American Presidents Series: The 6th President, 1825–1829 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=USA4AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA127 |publisher= Henry Holt and Company |page= 127}}</ref> Van Buren won his election, and resigned from the Senate to start the gubernatorial term, which began on January 1, 1829.<ref>{{cite book |last= Benjamin |first= Gerald |date= 2012 |title= The Oxford Handbook of New York State Government and Politics |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=l3AnAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA322 |publisher= Oxford University Press |page= 322}}</ref>

Martin Van Buren's tenure as New York governor is the second shortest on record. While his term was short, he did manage to pass the Bank Safety Fund Law (an early form of deposit insurance) through the Legislature.<ref>{{cite book |last= Neu |first= Irene D. |date= 1960 |title= Erastus Corning: Merchant and Financier, 1794–1872 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jEDlH_ryLw4C&pg=PA91 |publisher= Cornell University Press  |page= 91}}</ref>

==Secretary of State==
On March 5, 1829, President Jackson appointed Van Buren [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], an office which probably had been assured to him before the 1828 elections, and Van Buren resigned the governorship on March 12.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA183 ''The Annals of Albany''] published by Joel Munsell (Albany, 1855; p. 183)</ref> He was succeeded by his Lieutenant Governor, [[Enos T. Throop]], a member of the Regency.

===Secretary of State===
As Secretary of State, Van Buren took care to keep on good terms with the [[Kitchen Cabinet]], Jackson's informal advisers.  He sometimes opposed Jackson in the matter of removing political appointees from office to replace them with Jackson loyalists, but also saw to the replacement of postmasters in New York with Van Buren loyalists.<ref>{{cite book |last= Cole |first= Donald B. |date= 1984 |title= Martin Van Buren and the American Political System |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vqz_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA195 |publisher= Princeton University Press |page= 195}}</ref>

No serious diplomatic crises arose during Van Buren's tenure, but he achieved several notable successes, including the settlement of long-standing claims against France, winning reparations for property that had been seized during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  He reached an agreement with the British to open trade with the [[British West Indies]] colonies.  In addition, Van Buren completed a treaty with the [[Ottoman Empire]] that gained American merchants access to the [[Black Sea]].  Items on which he did not achieve success included settling the [[Maine]]-[[New Brunswick]] boundary dispute with Great Britain, gaining settlement of the U.S. claim to the [[Oregon Country]], concluding a commercial treaty with [[Russia]], and persuading [[Mexico]] to sell [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Cole |first= Donald B. |date= 1984 |title= Martin Van Buren and the American Political System |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vqz_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA203 |publisher= Princeton University Press |page= 203}}</ref><ref name="Martin Van Buren">{{cite web |url= http://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/van-buren-martin |title= Martin Van Buren |website= Biographies of the Secretaries of State |publisher= U.S. Department of State, Office of the Historian |accessdate= November 8, 2014}}</ref>

Van Buren also advised Jackson informally on matters of domestic policy.  In the controversy over the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]], he sided with Jackson.  He also sided with Jackson on the [[Indian Removal Act]].<ref name="Martin Van Buren"/><ref>{{cite book |last= Kincade |first= Vance Robert |date= 2000 |title= Heirs Apparent: Solving the Vice Presidential Dilemma |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fcSZ36r252cC&pg=PA49 |publisher= Praeger Publishers |page= 49}}</ref>  After the breach between Jackson and Calhoun, which culminated with the [[Nullification Crisis]], Van Buren's position as one of Jackson's primary political supporters and policy advisors clearly marked him as the most prominent candidate for the vice presidency in 1832, and Jackson's most likely successor in 1836.<ref>{{cite book |last= Purcell |first= L.

===Petticoat affair===

{{Further information|Petticoat affair}}
Van Buren won Jackson's lasting regard by his courtesies to [[Peggy Eaton]], wife of [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[John H. Eaton]], with whom the wives of the cabinet members had refused to associate.<ref>{{cite book |last= Heller III |first= J.

As a widower, Van Buren was unaffected by the position of the Cabinet wives, and he supported Jackson's position that criticism of the Eatons would not be tolerated. The anti-Eaton effort was led by Calhoun's wife, [[Floride Calhoun|Floride]], and Jackson's opponents, including Calhoun, hoped to use it to gain political leverage.  By siding with Jackson, Van Buren helped create a counter-coalition that weakened Calhoun.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cheathem |first=Mark R. |date=2015 |title=Andrew Jackson and the Rise of the Democrats: A Reference Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXq1BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA131 |location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=131 |isbn=978-1-61069-406-3}}</ref>

The dispute was finally resolved when Van Buren offered to resign; Jackson eventually accepted, which gave him the opportunity to reorganize his cabinet by asking for the resignations of Cabinet members whose wives were part of the anti-Eaton coalition.<ref>{{cite book |last= Watson |first=Robert P. |date=2012 |title=Affairs of State: The Untold History of Presidential Love, Sex, and Scandal, 1789–1900 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6LRVg0kn28C&pg=PA196 |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=196 |isbn=978-1-4422-1834-5}}</ref>  Postmaster General [[William T.

In December 1829, Jackson had already made known his wish that Van Buren receive the 1832 vice presidential nomination.<ref>Meacham, Jon, American Lion, Random House (2008), p. 308</ref>  After resigning as Secretary of State in April 1831 as part of resolving the Petticoat affair, Van Buren remained in office until June, and afterwards continued to play a part in Jackson's [[Kitchen Cabinet]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Manweller |first=Mathew  |date=2012 |title=Chronology of the U.S. Presidency |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uqB3ehA7M0oC&pg=PA246 |location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=246 |isbn=978-1-59884-646-1}}</ref> In August 1831 Jackson gave Van Buren a [[recess appointment]] as [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Minister to the Court of St. James (Britain)]] and he arrived in London in September.<ref>{{cite book |last= Shepard |first= Edward Shepard |date= 1899 |title= American Statesmen: Martin Van Buren |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SEVHrdmXiFMC&pg=PA224 |publisher= Houghton, Mifflin & Co. |page= 224}}</ref>  He was cordially received, but in February, he learned that his nomination had been rejected by the Senate on January 25, 1832.<ref>{{cite book |last= Polk |first= James Knox |date= 1886 |title= Correspondence of James K. Polk: January-June 1845 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wxmLh0gDfSoC&pg=PA357 |publisher= University of Tennessee Press |page= 357}}</ref>  The rejection was attributed by the Senate to Van Buren's instructions while Secretary of State to [[Louis McLane]], the American minister to Britain.  Van Buren's instructions, which concerned the opening of the West Indies trade, supposedly repudiated the foreign policy of Jackson's predecessors, which the Senate claimed was a breach of decorum.<ref>{{cite book |last= Remini |first= Robert V. |date= 1991 |title= Henry Clay: Statesman for the Union |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f9Hb6i90_mAC&pg=PA380 |publisher= W. W. Norton & Company |page= 380}}</ref>  In fact, the rejection of Van Buren was the work of Calhoun, who had opposed Van Buren's confirmation, believing that Van Buren had attempted to keep him from becoming vice president by making overtures to [[Henry Clay]] to run on a ticket with William H. Crawford, Van Buren's preferred candidate for president in 1824.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cole |first=Donald B. |date=1984 |title=Martin van Buren and the American Political System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqz_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA124 |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=124 |isbn=978-0-691-04715-7}}</ref>  Calhoun also opposed Van Buren for his role in the Petticoat Affair and his work on the 1828 tariff.  When the vote on Van Buren's nomination was taken, enough pro-Calhoun Democrats refrained from voting to produce a tie, thus giving Calhoun, in his role as presiding officer, the ability to cast a vote.  He voted against Van Buren, and so achieved "vengeance" on Van Buren.<ref>{{cite book |last= Risjord |first= Norman K. |date= 2001 |title= Representative Americans: The Romantics |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gIwySAwf6DUC&pg=PA42 |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield |page= 42}}</ref>

Calhoun was elated, convinced that he had ended Van Buren's career.  "It will kill him dead, sir, kill him dead.  He will never kick, sir, never kick," Calhoun exclaimed to a friend within earshot of Missouri Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Howe |first= Daniel Walker |date= 2007 |title= What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815–1848 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0XIvPDF9ijcC&pg=PA378 |publisher= Oxford University Press |page= 378}}</ref>
[[File:Francis Alexander - Martin Van Buren - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|A painting of Van Buren by Francis Alexander, c. 1830-1840]]
Benton recognized the significance of Calhoun's action, saying "You have broken a minister and made a vice president."<ref>{{cite book |last=Blumenthal |first=Sidney |date=2016 |title=A Self-Made Man: The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln |volume=I |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqQbDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA123 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=123 |isbn=978-1-4767-7725-2}}</ref>  [[John Tyler]], then serving as a Senator from [[Virginia]], also recognized Calhoun's overreach, writing to a friend that "Van Buren is elevated by the silly thing of rejecting him."<ref>{{cite book |last=Tyler |first=Lyon Gardiner |date=1884 |title=The Letters and Times of the Tylers |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GLRYAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA439 |location=Richmond, VA |publisher=Whittet & Shepperson |page=439}}</ref>

As Benton and Tyler foresaw, Calhoun's move backfired by making Van Buren seem the victim of petty politics, thus raising him in both Jackson's regard and the esteem of others in the Democratic Party.  Far from ending Van Buren's career, Calhoun's action gave greater impetus to Van Buren's candidacy for vice president.<ref>{{cite book |last= Haynes |first= Stan M. |date= 2012 |title= The First American Political Conventions: Transforming Presidential Nominations, 1832–1872|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mSud-fdhUnkC&pg=PA34 |publisher= McFarland & Company, Inc. |page= 34}}</ref>

After a brief tour of Europe, Van Buren reached New York on July 5, 1832. The May [[1832 Democratic National Convention]], the party's first, had nominated him for vice president on the Jackson ticket.<ref>{{cite book |last= Silbey |first= Joel H. |date= 2002 |title= Martin Van Buren and the Emergence of American Popular Politics |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9gUwSOypTuIC&pg=PA82 |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield |pages= 81–82}}</ref> Van Buren's nomination was not as strongly supported as Jackson's, particularly among southerners who recalled his work on the tariff in 1828, but he somewhat placated southerners by denying the right of Congress to abolish slavery in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] without the consent of the slave states.<ref>{{cite book |last= Leeper |first= Clare D'Artois  |date= 2012 |title= Louisiana Place Names: Popular, Unusual, and Forgotten Stories of Towns, Cities, Plantations, Bayous, and even some Cemeteries |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHeeUa0xNxcC&pg=PA256 |publisher= Louisiana State University Press |page= 256}}</ref>

The Jackson-Van Buren ticket won the 1832 election, and Van Buren took office as Vice President in March 1833.<ref>{{cite book |last= Holland |first= William M. |date= 1836 |title= The Life and Political Opinions of Martin Van Buren, Vice President of the United States |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2s1cI5uNNZQC&pg=PA344 |publisher= Belknap & Hammersley |page= 344}}</ref>  During his time in office Van Buren continued to be one of Jackson's primary advisors and confidants, and accompanied Jackson on his tour of the northeastern United States in 1833.<ref>{{cite book |last= Purcell |first= L.

Van Buren's support of Jackson in the Nullification Crisis and the decision not to recharter the Second Bank of the United States made him a target of Jackson's most vocal opponents.  Van Buren was threatened with violence, including explicit comments from Senator [[George Poindexter]] of Mississippi, which caused Van Buren to carry pistols for self-defense.<ref>{{cite book |last1=MacNeil  |first1=Neil |last2=Baker |first2=Richard A. |date=2013 |title=The American Senate: An Insider's History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpAAcznipJEC&pg=PA283 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=283 |isbn=978-0-19-536761-4}}</ref>  However he also demonstrated both the willingness and the ability to work with his opponents, cooperating with Clay and Calhoun (now a Senator) to pass the compromise [[Tariff of 1833]], which helped end the Nullification Crisis.<ref>{{cite book |last= Navarro |first= Bob |date= 2006 |title= The Era of Change: Executives and Events in a Period of Rapid Expansion |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eXTvt4q00zAC&pg=PA77 |publisher= Xlibris Corporation |pages= 77–78}}</ref>

During one contentious debate on the bank issue, Van Buren presided over the Senate as Clay spoke passionately about the harm he believed Jackson's bank policy would cause.  Directing his remarks to Van Buren, Clay asked rhetorically whether Van Buren would approach Jackson and persuade him to change his mind.  After Clay concluded, observers wondered how Van Buren would react.  Van Buren's response was to descend from the rostrum and ask Clay if he could borrow a pinch of [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]].  Caught off guard, Clay reflexively handed over his [[snuff box]].  Van Buren took a pinch, bowed to Clay, and left the chamber, both deflating the effect of Clay's remarks and preventing tension from escalating, as would have happened if Van Buren had attempted to reply directly.<ref>{{cite book |last= Boller |first= Paul F. |date= 1996 |title= Presidential Anecdotes |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N0JRvfAIUFwC&pg=PA87 |publisher= Oxford University Press |page= 87}}</ref>

Van Buren was [[unanimity|unanimously]] nominated by the [[1835 Democratic National Convention]] at [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]. On the issue of slavery, Van Buren moved to obtain the support of southerners by assuring them that he opposed abolitionism and supported the maintaining of slavery in states where it had already existed.<ref>{{cite book |last= Howe |first= Daniel Walker |date= 2007 |title= What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815–1848 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0XIvPDF9ijcC&pg=PA509 |publisher= Oxford University Press |pages= 508–509}}</ref> Regarding the national bank, Van Buren made clear that he opposed rechartering a [[Second Bank of the United States|national bank]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Nowlan |first= Robert A. |date= |title=The American Presidents, Washington to Tyler: What They Did, What They Said, What Was Said About Them, With Full Source Notes |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MlNWU1e9ppUC&pg=PA319 |publisher= McFarland Books |page= 319}}</ref> To demonstrate [[good faith|consistency]] regarding his opinions on slavery, Van Buren cast the tie-breaking Senate vote in favor of [[Enrolled bill|engrossing]] a bill to subject [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] mail to state laws, thus ensuring that its circulation would be prohibited in the South.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Martin_VanBuren.htm |title= Martin Van Buren, 8th Vice President (1833–1837) |website= U.S. Senate History |publisher= U.S. Senate, Office of the Historian |accessdate= November 8, 2014}}</ref>

Martin Van Buren's competitors [[United States presidential election, 1836|in the 1836 election]] were the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]]; they ran several regional candidates in hopes of sending the election to the House of Representatives, where each state delegation would have one vote and the Whigs would stand a better chance of winning.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nelson |first= Michael |date= 2013 |title= Guide to the Presidency and the Executive Branch |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4iNzAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1962 |publisher= CQ Press |page= 1962}}</ref> [[William Henry Harrison]] hoped to receive the support of the Western voters, [[Daniel Webster]] had strength in New England, and [[Hugh Lawson White]] and [[Willie Person Mangum]] had support in the South.

Martin Van Buren announced his intention "to follow in the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor", and retained all but one of Jackson's cabinet. Van Buren had few economic tools to deal with the [[Panic of 1837]]. The Panic was followed by a five-year [[Depression (economics)|depression]] in which banks failed and [[unemployment]] reached record highs.<ref>W. J. Rorabaugh, Donald T. Critchlow, Paula C. Baker (2004). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VL_6X5zWOokC&pg=PA210&dq=PA349&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false America's promise: a concise history of the United States]''". Rowman & Littlefield. p.210. ISBN 0742511898</ref> Some modern economists have argued that the Panic was caused by the Jackson administration's bank policies, with the power to create money being distributed into decentralized banks (most of which would then continue to cause a massive inflationary bubble).<ref>{{cite web |title=Age of Jackson: Crash Course US History #14 |work=CrashCourse  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beN4qE-e5O8 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref>

Van Buren advocated lower tariffs and free trade, and by doing so maintained support of the South for the Democratic Party. He succeeded in setting up a system of bonds for the national debt. His party was so split that his 1837 proposal for an "Independent Treasury" system did not pass until 1840. It gave the Treasury control of all federal funds and had a legal tender clause that required, by 1843, all payments to be made in [[Coin|specie]], but further inflamed public opinion on both sides.<ref>{{cite book |last= Gouge |first= William A. |last2=Dorfman |first2=Joseph|date=2007 |title= A Short History of Money and Banking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXtCpeGQeuAC&pg=PA22|location=Auburn, Alabama |publisher= Ludwig Van Mises Institute|page=22}}</ref> In the field of labor conditions, an Executive Order issued by Van Buren in 1840 established the 10-hour day for laborers on all federal public works.<ref>{{cite book |last=McCrudden |first=Christopher |date=2007 |title=Buying Social Justice: Equality, Government Procurement, & Legal Change |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=P0yuJCEWjLQC&pg=PA37 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=37 |isbn=978-0-19-923243-7}}</ref>

In a bold step, Van Buren reversed Andrew Jackson's policies and sought peace at home, as well as abroad. Instead of settling a financial dispute between American citizens and the Mexican government by force, Van Buren wanted to seek a diplomatic solution. In an action that upset political leaders of the pro-slavery states, in August 1837, Van Buren denied [[Texas]]' formal request to join the United States, partly to prevent the upset of the slave state/free state balance in the [[Missouri Compromise]], and partly because he hoped to avoid the possibility of war with Mexico over Texas annexation by purchasing the territory from the Mexican government.<ref>{{cite book |last= Conlin |first=Joseph |date=2014 |title=The American Past: A Survey of American History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXQWAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA330 |location=Boston |publisher=Wadsworth: Cengage Learning |page=330 |isbn=978-1-133-94653-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Freidel  |first=Frank |date=1999 |title=Presidents of the United States of America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5i2I5Uqi8sMC&pg=PA23 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=White House Historical Association |page=23 |isbn=978-0-912308-72-2}}</ref>

In 1839, [[Joseph Smith|Joseph Smith, Jr.]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], visited Van Buren to plead for the U.S. to help roughly 20,000 Mormon settlers of [[Independence, Missouri]] (who were forced from the state during the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]]) there. The Governor of Missouri, [[Lilburn Boggs]], had issued [[Missouri Executive Order 44|an executive order]] on October 27, 1838, known as the "Extermination Order". It authorized troops to use force against Mormons to "exterminate or drive [them] from the state".<ref>{{cite web |title=Extermination Order |work=LDS FAQ |url=http://ldsfaq.byu.edu/emmain.asp?number=74 |accessdate=22 August 2005}}</ref><ref>Boggs, Extermination Order</ref> In 1839, after moving to Illinois, Smith and his party appealed to members of Congress and to President Van Buren to intercede for the Mormons. According to Smith's grandnephew, Van Buren said to Smith, "Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you; if I take up for you I shall lose the vote of Missouri".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Joseph Fielding |authorlink=Joseph Fielding Smith |title=Church History and Modern Revelation |volume=4 |pages=167–173 |publisher=Deseret |date=1946–1949}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Ann Eliza Young |author2=John Bartholomew Gough |author3=Mary Ashton Rice Livermore |title=Wife no. 19, or, the story of a life of bondage |page=55 |year=1876 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5URCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q}}</ref>

===Slavery===
While in the state Senate Van Buren voted for a resolution instructing New York's members of Congress to vote against the admission of [[Missouri]] as a slave state.  In [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848]] he would be the nominated for president by the [[Free Soil Party]] (an anti-slavery political party).<ref>Junius P. Rodriguez (1997).
